# Data Science Capstone Project: Viral Toy Trends & Digital Consumer Behavior

## Project Overview

This project explores the psychological triggers behind impulsive purchases and digital consumer behavior across platforms and regions. We focused on how rapid content cycles and algorithmic targeting on social media stimulate dopamine-driven shopping habits, with a particular emphasis on viral toy microtrends and their impact on consumer psychology.

## Core Focus: Tableau Data Visualizations

The heart of this project lies in the four Tableau dashboards that transform complex consumer behavior data into interactive, insightful visualizations. Our first visualization examines consumer perceptions of scarcity on TikTok Shop in Vietnam, showing how urgency, limited availability, and FOMO drive impulse purchases regionally. The second tracks the virality of toys from 2020–2025 using Google Trends and hashtags, revealing the influence of short-lived microtrends. The third highlights product discovery patterns, showing Instagram as the top platform for recommendations, followed by TikTok and X/Twitter. The fourth analyzes U.S. shopping behavior, exposing a gap between sustainable intentions and actions—70% of Americans still prefer new items over secondhand options.

## Data Pipeline & Processing

Our data journey began with raw datasets from Kaggle, Google Trends API, and social media surveys. We started with Google Sheets for initial organization and basic cleaning, then moved to SQL for more complex transformations and data querying. The final step involved Tableau for creating interactive dashboards that could tell compelling stories about consumer behavior.

The data cleaning process was systematic. We began by assessing data quality and completeness, then handled missing values strategically. Outlier detection was crucial for identifying anomalous data points that could skew our analysis. We standardized formats across multiple data sources and validated data integrity through cross-checking. The transformation phase involved aggregating individual responses into meaningful categories, normalizing scales for fair comparison and creating derived variables for deeper analysis.

## Website Development & AI Transparency

This website was built with somewhat assistance of AI coding tools to accelerate development while maintaining focus on our core data science objectives. Our primary focus was data visualization and analysis, not web development, so using AI tools allowed me to spend more time on data cleaning and analysis while ensuring professional website presentation.

## Key Insights & Findings

Our analysis revealed fascinating patterns in viral toy microtrends. Each year from 2020-2025 had one dominant viral toy: Mini Brands (2020), Pop Its (2021), Squishmallows (2022), Sonny Angel (2024), and Labubu (2025). Social media platforms dramatically accelerated trend lifecycles from years to weeks, creating intense but short-lived consumer interest.

Regional differences in digital behavior were striking. Consumers in Can Tho consistently reported the highest concern across all scarcity factors—promotion deadlines, time limits, quantity constraints, and fear of stockouts. In contrast, provinces like Tra Vinh and Soc Trang showed lower levels of scarcity concern, revealing regional differences in digital shopping psychology.

## Educational Value

This project serves as a comprehensive example of the complete data science workflow, from raw data to actionable insights. It demonstrates Tableau & SQL mastery through advanced visualization techniques and dashboard design, while providing insights into consumer behavior analysis and research methodology.
